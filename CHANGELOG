# 0.6.0

It's now possible to specify an image description when attaching
an image to a post. The keyword is `alt`, like in HTML.

To upgrade from a prior version, you'll need to run the migration
script `migration/20181221-add-attachment-alt.sql`. Something like
this should work:

$ sqlite3 bots/botfriend.sqlite < migration/20181221-add-attachment-alt.sql
