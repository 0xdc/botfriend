# 0.6.0

## Notes

To upgrade from a prior version, you'll need to run the migration
script `migration/20181221-add-attachment-alt.sql`. Something like
this should work:

$ sqlite3 bots/botfriend.sqlite < migration/20181221-add-attachment-alt.sql

## New features

It's now possible to specify an image description when attaching
an image to a post. The keyword is `alt`, like in HTML.

It's now easy to write bots whose output is a podcast feed.
