Binary:
    filename (within directory based on bot config and post date)

Bots are loaded from subdirectories. Each has an __init__.py and a config.yaml

for bot in bots:
    if bot.should_post():
       bot.post()

post() generates the post, sends it to all deliveries

You can also fill the posts table with unposted posts. If there are unposted
posts, post() will choose one and post it rather than calling out to
the submodule code.

# Should post?

Just look at next post time

Next post time is calculated after a successful post
