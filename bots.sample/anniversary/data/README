Various lists of materials for the Anniversary Materials bot. These
are not in data/more-corpora/ because the appeal is so limited.

dwarf_fortress.txt - Materials and items found in Dwarf Fortress.
Source: http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/

gutenberg.txt - Materials found by searching Project Gutenberg books
for the same queries ("made of", etc.) used to find materials on
Twitter.

minecraft.txt - Materials and objects found in Minecraft (as of 1.12).

moma.txt - Materials used in artworks in MoMA's collection.
Source: https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection

real_life.txt - Materials for real life anniversaries. Unlike the
other files, this file is used to _restrict_ the output of the bot so
that it doesn't say that e.g. the 12th anniversary is for gold.
