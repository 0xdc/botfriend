This TextGeneratorBot illustrates some advanced features of botfriend:

* State management.
* Optional use of publisher credentials (Twitter) to maintain state.
* Extensive use of corpora datasets.

To make it post, run the botfriend.post script.

$ botfriend.post anniversary

The output will be published to sample-bots/anniversary/anniversary.txt.

If this bot is configured with Twitter credentials, it will search
Twitter for additional materials. But it will work fine with no
Twitter credentials.
