Boat Names

This simple bot does nothing but pull strings from its backlog and
post them one at a time.

See roller-derby for a slightly more complex bot that also posts from
its backlog.

To try this bot out, use the backlog-load script to load the backlog.

$ ./backlog-load --config=sample-bots --bot=boat-names --file=sample-bots/boat-names/backlog.txt

Then you can use the post script to post items:

$ ./post --config=sample-bots --bot=boat-names

The posts will show up in sample-bots/boat-names/boat-names.txt
