Roy's Postcards

This is the official code, but only three sample postcards are
included, plus the metadata for a fourth card that is not present.

This example demonstrates some advanced features of botfriend:

* You can load posts with attachments into the backlog. If a post
  mentions an attachment that can't be found, that post will be skipped
  and not loaded into the backlog.

* You can publish dramatically different content to different
  publications. The higher Mastodon character limit allows the
  postcard inscription to be included in the post.

* The JSON document stored in the backlog is stored as Post.state once
  the post is created. You can access this in Bot.post_to_publisher
  to customize what gets sent to which publisher.
