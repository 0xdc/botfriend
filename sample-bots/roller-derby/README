This bot does nothing but post items from its backlog. It illustrates
some advanced features of botfriend:

* Instead of a backlog of strings to be posted (like the boat-names
  bot), the backlog is a series of JSON lists. The
  Bot.object_to_post() method turns one of these lists into a string
  that gets published.

Use the backlog-load script to load the backlog.

$ ./backlog-load --config=sample-bots --bot=roller-derby --file=sample-bots/roller-derby/backlog.ndjson

Then you can use the post script to post items:

$ ./post --config=sample-bots --bot=roller-derby

The posts will show up in sample-bots/roller-derby/roller-derby.txt
