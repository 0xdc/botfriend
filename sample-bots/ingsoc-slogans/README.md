This Twitter-specific bot has some unique features:

* Every time it posts, it deletes all previous posts and modifies its
  Twitter bio.
* It has an extra software dependency, which you can install with `pip
   install PyDictionary`.

This bot will not post unless you give it Twitter credentials. To make
it post, run the post script.

$ ./post --config=sample-bots --bot=ingsoc-slogans
